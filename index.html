			<h2>An Introduciton</h2>
		<p>
			Love the bomb. It is coming in one way or another. In the mean time, 
			doctors suggest that the best remdy is to enjoy yourself before the mushroom clouds your vision.
			<br/>
			This page is designed as a retreat from the chaos of modern living and the beloved 24 hour news stream. 
			This collection of static html pages hopes to take you back to a simpler time that probably never existed.
			<br/>
			Here I have colleted a series of projects that I have started in my free time, and I hope that you, the veiwer, find them of some interest. You might come to realize that there is no way to interact with the content on this site (I promise this is due some underlying philisophical reason and not at all due to my complete lack of technical ability). Anyways the underlying philosophy is that everything on this site is free to take and use for what ever purpose you, the viewer, sees fit The reason you cannot interact with it is that I have no idea how to create and manage comments, upvotes, etc.
			Well that is all that I have. In fact, the only reason I am still writing is that I would like to have the text cover the entire length of the image to the left to make the site more "even". This is peice of the Berlin Wall that I took a picture of in a museum. Cool stuff.
