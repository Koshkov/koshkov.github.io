			This is a a website that I have made on github pages. It is free to use.
			This is just a fun project to do. Learning
			how a website works is a good skill to add to your tool box, and it
			can help pass the time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Feel free to look around. This site is still under construction. I have a photo gallery of 
			some pictures I have taken over the years, and I am currently working on a page with my 
			programming projects, and I am setting up a blog page. Fun fact: The picture to the left is a piece 
			of the Berlin Wall on display at the Newseum in Washington D.C.

			Finally, if you want a place to jump off from, feel free to use the source code. 
			It can be found in my public
			<a href="https://github.com/Koshkov/koshkov.github.io"> github respository </a>
			I wrote this all from scratch using basic HTML and CSS. If you need help setting one up, 
			you can just email me.
